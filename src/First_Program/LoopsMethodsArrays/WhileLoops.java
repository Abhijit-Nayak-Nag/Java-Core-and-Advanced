// while loop does not support three different statement in a single line i.e. Initialization,
// Condition , and Updation, but,for loop support.
//for loop is a finite loop we know how many times loop will execute based on a
// certain condition. but for while loop is a infinite kind of loop we dont know how many
//times loop will execute.
// In java, semicolon(;) dived different statement the number of times you used semicolon
// compiler will consider it as a different statement.
